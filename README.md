# SDC-T2-P1
Udacity Self-Drving-Car Term2 P1 Kalman Filter

## Implemenation
Most of the code are from the EKF course. No need to further explain here.

## Result
Output results in folder CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/output:
*  output-file.txt is the config in sheme to output prediction into.
*  newplot.png is generated by the ekf-visulization notebook provided by the project.
*  output_from_console is copied from console output, which indicates my px, py, vx, and vy RMSE is [0.0973826,0.0853209,0.441738,0.453757] that meets the criterion (< [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52]).
